I'm a Machine Learning Engineer transitioning from applied ML in government research to fundamental AI research. I focus on model optimization, mechanistic interpretability, and reinforcement learning for complex decision-making.

## Background

I spent 6+ years developing production ML systems for federal agencies and research institutions, including:
- **Booz Allen Hamilton** - Optimizing ML systems for cybersecurity and real-time analysis
- **RAND Corporation** - Leading ML research on adversarial robustness and distribution shift
- **Brookhaven National Laboratory** - Building production ML systems for malware analysis
- **FBI** - Developing automation tools for security analysis

**Education:**
- MS in Applied Mathematics & Statistics - Stony Brook University (2021)
- MS in Physics - Seton Hall University (2020)  
- BS in Mathematics - Seton Hall University (2018)

**Selected Publications:**
- "Understanding the Limits of Artificial Intelligence for Warfighters: Distributional Shift in Cybersecurity Datasets" - RAND Corporation, 2022
- "Technological and Economic Threats to the U.S. Financial System" - RAND Corporation, 2024

## Current Focus

I'm pivoting toward fundamental ML research by:

1. **Implementing foundational papers** from scratch in JAX to deeply understand the mathematics and design choices
2. **Contributing to open-source** ML frameworks and tools
3. **Exploring research questions** in model efficiency and interpretability
